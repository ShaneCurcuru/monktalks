# [Welcome to Monktalks](https://shanecurcuru.github.io/monktalks/)!

This is a fan website about Monktoberfest - the Redmonk-run conference about how technology shapes humanity. And beer. üçª

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from Monktoberfest attendees to build a historical record of all the great talks that have happened at the event.  Since most of this data is fairly simple, just submit a PR with your changes, and understand all contributions are considered under Apache-2.0.

Content is stored in _data in YAML files, see [m2023.yaml](https://github.com/ShaneCurcuru/monktalks/blob/main/_data/m2023.yaml).  Data fields should be self-explanatory; we store talk title (from the presentation itself), speaker(s), a brief description about the talk, and sometimes a high-level tag that ties talks together across the years.

Since many attendees livetweet talks, we also include a list of `threads` linking to some of the best, on The Platform Formerly Known As Twitter or other platforms.

## Thanks / Credits
