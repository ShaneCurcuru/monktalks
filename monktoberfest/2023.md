Monktoberfest 2023 built a new tradition at the open and airy venue at Thompson's point, a beautiful spot that helps you really think about all the awesome talks.

Redmonk has compiled a [highlight video from the 2023 Monktoberfest attendees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHeqakyWQT0)!

As Redmonk posts videos or other materials about this year's talks, we'll be listing them here - or you can submit a PR!
