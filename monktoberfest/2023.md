Monktoberfest 2023 is staying at the open and airy venue at Thompson's point, but obviously still features the traditional boat cruise and studio dinner.

Since Monktoberfest has a tradition of secrecy around the themes and sessions for each conference, newcomers may be curious as to what to expect during this single-track conference.  Don't worry, I've got you covered, with an unofficial schedule of all the sessions coming this year!
