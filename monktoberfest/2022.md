Monktoberfest 2022 returned at a smaller size and different venue in the new pandemic world.  With vaccine and daily testing requirements, along with a very open and airy venue at Thompson's point, attendees could relax a bit with some COVID risks.

While videos of sessions won't be posted for a bit yet - while the awesome Redmonk staff takes a break - we do have some livetweeted threads describing each of this year's talks.
