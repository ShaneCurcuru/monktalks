Monktoberfest 2022 returned at a smaller size and different venue in the new pandemic world.  With vaccine and daily testing requirements, along with a very open and airy venue at Thompson's point, attendees could relax a bit with some COVID risks.

Stephen has his usual [annual wrap-up blog post](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/10/26/the-2022-monktoberfest/), and Stephen also noted the [#20YearsOfRedMonk flash hashtag](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2022/11/03/birthday-surprise/) with thanks from many, many attendees.

Redmonk has an [overview & explainer video from attendee interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AqBrIKvFr4) too.
