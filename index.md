Welcome to MonkTalks, an unofficial fan site for [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/faq/) and all the great past speakers. Many thanks to Stephen and James and everyone at [Redmonk](https://redmonk.com/team/) too!

This site is open source, so if something's not quite right, [please help fix it](https://github.com/ShaneCurcuru/monktalks)!

## What is Monktoberfest?

The creator Stephen has a hard time [explaining Monktoberfest](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2019/10/10/the-2019-monktoberfest/) himself, coming down to "look at the intersection of technology and the world around us â€“ the good, the bad and the ugly".  I'd say it's "how technology shapes society - and how to help".

Monktoberfest is a place you can find talks you won't find anywhere else - plus great food, a 100% great set of attendees, and of course the best food and beer of any tech conference ever.

Past speakers at Monktoberfest have been so inspiring, I decided to make a list of all the speakers I could find videos for.  I hope you enjoy!
